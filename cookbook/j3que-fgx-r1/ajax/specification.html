	<p>This is a cookbook prototype of a multi-window user experience.</p>
	<p>The windows are intended to provide the 2D user interface that control aspects of an underlying 3D display.</p>
	<p>Requirements include the following: <br>
	<ul>
		<li>There is a selection of themes available. 
			These themes are user-selectable and the display updates as soon as a new theme is seleected</li>
		<li>The windows may be freely moved and resized</li> 
		<li>The windows may be minimized using the '-' icon and closed using the 'x' icon</li>
		<li>All settings - themes, window positions and sizes as well as particular app setings - may be saved for future use and sent as permalinks</li>
		<li>Multiple sesssions may be open at the same time - each with different settings</li>
