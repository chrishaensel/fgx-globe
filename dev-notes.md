* The script is a heavy user of computing resources. A fast CPU and good graphics adaptor really helps ( just as with FlightGear )
* You can rotate, zoom and pan as you wish with fingers or pointing device
* Everything is under a GPL license and hosted on GitHub
* It all runs in your browser and loads in a few seconds
* Should work on Chrome, FF, Edge and Safari and on Android, iOS and Chromebooks


## 2016-02-16?
Complete code re-write

A FlightGear MultiPlayer Viewer

* A fast-loading dashboard ~ no attempts to convey 'realism'
* Rotate, zoom and pan with one, two and three fingers
* See who is flying what and where are they going
* Displays trajectories of flights
* Under 650 lines of low-complexity JavaScript
* Uses WebGL ~ runs in your browser

Mission

* To provide entry level coders with examples of simple techniques for 3D mapping, animation and accessing a REST API 
 

Issues

* Many aircraft models missing
* Incorrect material parameters in current models
* Aircraft are not deleted upon pilot exit
* Aircraft tend to become buried in the terrain
