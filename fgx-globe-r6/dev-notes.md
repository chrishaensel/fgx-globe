Complete code re-write

A FlightGear MultiPlayer Viewer

* A fast-loading dashboard ~ no attempts to convey 'realism'
* Rotate, zoom and pan with one, two and three fingers
* See who is flying what and where are they going
* Displays trajectories of flights
* Under 650 lines of low-complexity JavaScript
* Uses WebGL ~ runs in your browser

Mission

* To provide entry level coders with examples of simple techniques for 3D mapping, animation and accessing a REST API 
 

Issues

* Many aircraft models missing
* Incorrect material parameters in current models
* Aircraft are not deleted upon pilot exit
* Aircraft tend to become buried in the terrain
